            The carrot is a root vegetable, most commonly observed as orange in color, though purple, black, red, white,
            and yellow cultivars exist, all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to
            Europe and Southwestern Asia.

            It is crunchy, tasty, and highly nutritious. Carrots are a particularly good source of beta carotene, fiber,

            They also have a number of health benefits. They’re a weight-loss-friendly food and have been linked to
            lower cholesterol levels and improved eye health.

            What’s more, their carotene antioxidants have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer.

            Carrots are found in many colors, including yellow, white, orange, red, and purple.

            Orange carrots get their bright color from beta carotene, an antioxidant that your body converts into
            vitamin A.
