            Cucumber, (Cucumis sativus), creeping plant of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), widely cultivated for its
            edible fruit. The nutritional value of the cucumber is low, but its delicate flavour makes it popular for
            salads and relishes. ... The cucumber plant is a tender annual with a rough, succulent, trailing stem.

            The cucumber plant is a tender annual with a rough, succulent, trailing stem. The hairy leaves have three to
            five pointed lobes, and the stem bears branched tendrils by which the plant can be trained to supports. The
            five-petaled yellow flowers are unisexual and produce a type of berry known as a pepo. The heat requirement
            is one of the highest among the common vegetables, and the fruits can become bitter if exposed to uneven
            watering conditions. The plants are susceptible to a number of bacterial and fungal diseases, including
            downy mildew, anthracnose, and Fusarium wilt.
