            Cabbage is a leafy green, red, or white biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its
            dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage, and belongs to the "cole crops" or brassicas,
            meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower; Brussels sprouts; and Savoy cabbage.

    It comes in a variety of shapes and colors, including red, purple, white and green, and its leaves can be either
    crinkled or smooth.
