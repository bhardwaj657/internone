            The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an edible root vegetable of the family Brassicaceae
            that was domesticated in Asia prior to Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world,
            being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with a pungent flavor.

        <p>
            Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular,
            tapering, or cylindrical. The root skin colour ranges from white through pink, red, purple, yellow, and
            green to black, but the flesh is usually white. The roots obtain their color from anthocyanins. Red
            varieties use the anthocyanin pelargonidin as a pigment, and purple cultivars obtain their color from
            cyanidin. Smaller types have a few leaves about 13 cm (5 in) long with round roots up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in
            diameter or more slender, long roots up to 7 cm (3 in) long. Both of these are normally eaten raw in
            salads. A longer root form, including oriental radishes, daikon or mooli, and winter radishes, grows up
            to 60 cm (24 in) long with foliage about 60 cm (24 in) high with a spread of 45 cm (18 in). The flesh of
            radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet, but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the
            ground too long. Leaves are arranged in a rosette. They have a lyrate shape, meaning they are divided
            pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes. The white flowers are borne on a
            racemose inflorescence. The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young.
