            Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from Canada to
            southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans
            independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild
            species traced a single origin for potatoes, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme
            northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago there, from a species
            in the Solanum brevicaule complex. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is
            indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.

            Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish.
            Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food
            supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and
            rice. Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes.
            Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands
            of south-central Chile. The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by
            region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern
            Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in
            production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading
            the world in overall production as of 2018.

                <h3>Varieties</h3>
            </b>

        <p>
            There are close to 4,000 varieties of potato each of which has specific agricultural or culinary
            attributes.[25] Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. In general, varieties are
            categorized into a few main groups based on common characteristics, such as russet potatoes (rough brown
            skin), red potatoes, white potatoes, yellow potatoes (also called Yukon potatoes) and purple potatoes. For
            culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness: floury or mealy baking potatoes
            have more starch (20–22%) than waxy boiling potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation
            in the comparative ratio of two different potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a
            long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where
            the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, which is a highly
            branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape after being boiled in water. Potatoes that are good
            for making potato chips or potato crisps are sometimes called "chipping potatoes", which means they meet the
            basic requirements of similar varietal characteristics, being firm, fairly clean, and fairly
            well-shaped.
