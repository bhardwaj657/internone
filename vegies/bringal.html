            Eggplant, aubergine or brinjal is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena is
            grown worldwide for its edible fruit. Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several
            cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition

            A serving of eggplant can provide at least 5% of a person’s daily requirement of fiber, copper, manganese,
            B-6, and thiamine. It also contains other vitamins and minerals.

            In addition, eggplants are a source of phenolic compounds that act as antioxidants.

            Antioxidants are molecules that help the body eliminate free radicals — unstable molecules that can damage
            cells if they accumulate in large amounts. Foods that contain antioxidants may help prevent a range of
            diseases.

            Among the antioxidants in eggplants are anthocyanins, including nasunin, lutein, and zeaxanthin.
