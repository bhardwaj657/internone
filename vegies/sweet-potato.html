            The sweet potato or sweetpotato is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the bindweed or morning glory
            family, Convolvulaceae. Its large, starchy, sweet-tasting, tuberous roots are used as a root vegetable. The
            young shoots and leaves are sometimes eaten as greens.

            Sweet potatoes are nutritious, high in fiber, very filling, and delicious. They can be eaten boiled, baked,
            steamed, or fried.

            Sweet potatoes are usually orange but also found in other colors, such as white, red, pink, violet, yellow,
            and purple.

            In some parts of North America, sweet potatoes are called yams. However, this is a misnomer since yams are a
            different species.

            Sweet potatoes are only distantly related to regular potatoes.
